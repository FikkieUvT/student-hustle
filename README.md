# AIRBNB, the new Student Hustle?

Research question: To what extent has the number of listings on Airbnb effect on the ratings in Paris? (personal, all cities in France)

## Motivation
*Still in progress*
*The inflation rate in the European Union increased from 1.2% in January to 5.3% in December of 2021.

For us students, everything is getting more expensive while we are not able to earn more. Therefore, this project focuses on the opportunity  to earn some money by renting your student room.*

Airbnb has been taking the world by storm since 2008 with their disruptive innovation in the tourism branch (Guttentag, 2015). Most hosts use this platform to earn extra income on their biggest asset, their house. They start with renting out their private extention of the house and sometimes grow into multiple units (Priceonomics, 2017). Of all the Airbnb listings, approximately 20% belongs to hosts who rent out multiple properties (Shannon L, Alexandra H, 2017). We suspect that there is a different culture between hosts who have one listing vs hosts who have multiple listings. 

Furthermore we expect that hosts with a single listing treat this as their own and take good care of it. They take more effort in welcoming their guests and making them feel at home. On the other side, we expect that hosts with multiple listings would be seeing this as a job and would look at guests more commercially. In this research we are going to compare the ratings of hosts with single/  a few listings to ratings of hosts with many listings. And try to find a correlation between the amount of listings and the rating hosts get.

The research method we will apply is regression analysis, we will use the method because our independent variable is a ratio and the dependent variable is an interval.

Conceptual model:

Number of listings ---> Ratings

Gaan we verschillende steden in een land vergelijken, of verschillende landen?


Misschien kunnen we de bezettingsgraad aan het onderzoek toevoegen?
