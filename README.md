# AirBnB, the new student hustle?

In which European city is renting out your private room on Airbnb most attractive in terms of income, ratings and coverage?

## Motivation
Nowadays, everything is getting more and more expensive. This phenomenon can be explained by price inflation, which means that prices of goods and services go up in a given period. In the European Union, the inflation rate increased from 1.2% in January 2021 to 5.3% in December 2021 (Eurostat, 2022). Especially the prices of food, gas, and housing went up. Housing had to deal with the most significant rent increase in six years, which caused problems for many people, such as falling behind on their rent and increasing debts (CBS, 2020). Mainly students are struck because students cannot earn much money due to their study load. Most students only have a modest side job to finance their studies, life, and student accommodation. Therefore, the rising prices are a severe problem. It is allowed for students to sublet their student rooms if it does not violate the tenancy agreement (Rijksoverheid, 2022). Therefore, students can earn money to rent out their student room during periods their room is not occupied. 

Airbnb is one of the most popular online marketplaces for renting and leasing accommodation for the night. Most hosts use this platform to earn extra income on their most significant asset, their home. On the one hand, it is possible to rent out entire apartments, but on the other hand, it is also possible to rent out shared or private rooms. Airbnb has been taking the world by storm since 2008, with 4 million hosts and 1 billion guest arrivals worldwide ever since (Guttentag, 2015). Therefore, Airbnb might offer students the opportunity to earn money by subletting their private room to others. 

Furthermore, students have the opportunity to start their studies in a city or country of their choice. There are differences in terms of cost of livings between cities. It is interesting to investigate whether students can benefit more from renting out their room in one city than in another. Therefore, this research investigates different European cities to help and advise students. Hence, the following research question is defined:

**In which European city is renting out a private room on Airbnb most attractive in terms of income, ratings, and coverage?**

In this research, it is expected that renting out a student room is an opportunity to generate some extra income. However, as cities in Europe differ from each other for example in terms of cost of living, it is expected that there are also differences in terms of coverage, satisfaction and estimated income for private rooms between European cities. Therefore, it is important to examine these differences between European cities.

## Method and results
To find out the most attractive city to rent out your room, we did the following:
- calculate average income and availability (this will be the independent variables)
- define the dependent variable. This will be the reviews/ratings per room
- examine the relationship between the IV and the DV
- If the relationship is significant, we could calculate in which city it would be most attractive to rent out your room

Why did we use linear regression, instead of for example a factor analysis? The p-values shows the different mean of each variable and its difference with the DV.

#Results
These graphs show our results. We can conclude that...

## About 
This project is conducted by 5 ambitious Marketing Analytics students; Henk-Jan Klijsen, Marije  Kok, Max van der Meulen, Rom√©e Hoeks and Thomas Hemrica for the course Data preparation. During this project the learned skills will put in practice to find out if it is attractive to rent out your own student room and if so, in which city is this the most attractive.
