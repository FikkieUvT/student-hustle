Research question: To what extent has the number of listings on Airbnb effect on the ratings in Paris? (personal, all cities in France)

## Motivation
Airbnb has been taking the world by storm since 2008 with their disruptive innovation in the tourism branch (Guttentag, 2015). Most hosts use this platform to earn extra income on their biggest asset, their house. They start with renting out their private extention of the house and sometimes grow into multiple units (Priceonomics, 2017). Of all the Airbnb listings, approximately 20% belongs to hosts who rent out multiple properties (Shannon L, Alexandra H, 2017). We suspect that there is a different culture between hosts who have one propery vs hosts who have multiple properties. 

Furthermore we expect that hosts with a single property treat this as their own and take good care of it. They take more effort in welcoming their guests and making them feel at home. On the otherside, hosts with multiple properties would be seeing this as a job and would look at guests more commercially. We aim to proof difference in culture via comparing ratings and finding correlation between a single property and higher ratings.
