# AIRBNB, the new student hustle?

Research question: In which European city is renting out your private room on Airbnb most attractive in terms of income, ratings and coverage?

## Motivation

For students, everything is getting more expensive while students are not able to earn more. Therefore, this project focuses on the opportunity  to earn some money by renting your own student room. Students have the problem that they often do not have the time to work many hours, but the price of many, including student rooms, is rising. The inflation rate in the European Union increased from 1.2% in January to 5.3% in December of 2021 (Eurostat, 2022). Is there a possibility to reduce the costs by renting out your (student) room on Airbnb?

Airbnb has been taking the world by storm since 2008 with their disruptive innovation in the tourism branch (Guttentag, 2015). Most hosts use this platform to earn extra income on their biggest asset, their house. They start with renting out their private extention of the house and sometimes grow into multiple units (Priceonomics, 2017). Of all the Airbnb listings, approximately 20% belongs to hosts who rent out multiple properties (Shannon L, Alexandra H, 2017). We suspect that there is a different culture between hosts who have one listing vs hosts who have multiple listings. 

Furthermore we expect that hosts with a single listing treat this as their own and take good care of it. They take more effort in welcoming their guests and making them feel at home. On the other side, we expect that hosts with multiple listings would be seeing this as a job and would look at guests more commercially. In this research we are going to compare the ratings of hosts with single/  a few listings to ratings of hosts with many listings. And try to find a correlation between the amount of listings and the rating hosts get.

The research method we will apply is regression analysis, we will use the method because our independent variable is a ratio and the dependent variable is an interval.
